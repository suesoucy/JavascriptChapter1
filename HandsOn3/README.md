Hands-On Project 1-3
Do the following:
1. Use your code editor to open project01-03_txt.html from the js01 ➤ project03 folder. Enter your name and the date in the comment section of the document and save it as project01-03.html.
2. Scroll down to the bottom of the file and locate the input element for the Submit Button.
3. Add an onclick event handler to the ﹤input﹥tag that changes the innerHTML value of the page element with the id “submitMsg” to the text message Thank you for your order. (Note: The entire JavaScript expression should be enclosed within a set of double quotation marks, but the id and the text message should be enclosed within single quotes.)
4. Save your changes to the file and then open project01-03.html in your web browser. Click the Submit button and verify that the text “Thank you for your order” appears on the bottom of the page.
